# Active Context: Decision Tree for Issue Escalation

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the initial implementation of the decision tree application, enhanced the recommendations, and successfully deployed the project to Vercel. The current focus is on:

1. ✅ Initializing the Git repository (completed)
2. ✅ Creating a GitHub repository and pushing the local repository (completed)
3. ✅ Deploying the application to Vercel (completed)
4. Setting up a Supabase project and implementing the database schema
5. Connecting the application to the Supabase backend
6. Testing the application with real users

## Recent Changes

- Created Next.js project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Set up configuration files (tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, next.config.js)
- Implemented Supabase client for database connection
- Created database schema with SQL for Supabase
- Designed decision tree data structure with question and result nodes
- Implemented UI components for the decision tree flow
- Added progress tracking and path history display
- Enhanced recommendations with more thoughtful guidance
- Created comprehensive documentation (README, DEPLOYMENT.md, TESTING.md)
- Added Git configuration files (.gitignore, LICENSE)
- Created Git initialization scripts for easy repository setup
- Updated Memory Bank documentation to reflect current project status
- Enhanced DEPLOYMENT.md with more detailed instructions
- Initialized Git repository with initial commit
- Created step-by-step deployment checklist (DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md)
- Created local testing scripts (test-local.bat and test-local.sh)
- Set up .env.local file for local development
- Updated README.md with deployment information
- Removed Interaction History section from clinerules.md while preserving repository URLs
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/pleabargain/decision-tree-when-to-escalate
- Pushed local repository to GitHub
- Deployed the application to Vercel at decision-tree-when-to-escalate.vercel.app

## Next Steps

1. **Supabase Setup**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the schema.sql script to set up the database schema
   - Generate API keys for the application
   - Configure row-level security policies

2. **Integration with Supabase**
   - Update the application to use the Supabase backend
   - Configure environment variables in Vercel for Supabase connection
   - Test the connection to ensure data is being retrieved correctly
   - Implement error handling for API calls

The application has been successfully deployed to Vercel at decision-tree-when-to-escalate.vercel.app. The next step is to set up the Supabase backend and connect it to the deployed application.

3. **Integration**
   - Update the application to use the Supabase backend
   - Test the connection to ensure data is being retrieved correctly
   - Implement error handling for API calls

4. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test the application with real users
   - Gather feedback on the decision tree logic
   - Refine the questions and recommendations
   - Improve the user interface based on feedback

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Requirements
- Evaluating whether authentication should be required or optional
- Considering role-based access control needs (regular users vs. management)
- Determining what user information needs to be stored

### Data Persistence
- Deciding what user data and responses should be stored
- Considering privacy implications and data retention policies
- Evaluating whether to store decision history for analytics

### User Experience
- Balancing simplicity with comprehensive decision-making
- Ensuring the application is accessible to all users
- Making the decision tree logic transparent and trustworthy

### Deployment Strategy
- Considering whether to use a staging environment for testing
- Planning for continuous integration and deployment
- Determining how to handle version updates to the decision tree

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript for all components and functions
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consistent naming conventions

### Component Structure
- Atomic design principles
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable, composable components
- Consistent prop interfaces

### State Management
- React useState and useEffect hooks for local state
- Potential future implementation of React Context for global state
- Clear data flow patterns

### API Integration
- Supabase client for database operations
- Error handling and loading states
- Caching strategies for improved performance

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- JSON is an effective format for storing hierarchical decision tree data
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with consistent design
- Next.js provides a solid foundation for building a responsive web application
- TypeScript helps catch errors early and improves code quality

### User Experience Insights
- Progress indicators help users understand where they are in the decision process
- Path history provides context and transparency
- Clear recommendations with next steps are essential for user confidence
- Mobile responsiveness is critical for accessibility

### Challenges Addressed
- Designed a flexible decision tree structure that can handle complex branching
- Created a responsive UI that works well on both desktop and mobile
- Implemented a mock decision tree for development without requiring Supabase connection
- Balanced simplicity with comprehensive decision-making

### Future Opportunities
- Custom decision tree editor for administrators
- Analytics dashboard for management insights
- Integration with ticketing or issue management systems
- Department-specific decision trees
