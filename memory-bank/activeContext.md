# Active Context: Decision Tree for Issue Escalation

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the initial implementation of the decision tree application, enhanced the recommendations, and prepared the project for deployment. The current focus is on:

1. âœ… Initializing the Git repository (completed)
2. Setting up a Supabase project and implementing the database schema
3. Deploying the application to Vercel
4. Connecting the application to the Supabase backend
5. Testing the application with real users

## Recent Changes

- Created Next.js project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Set up configuration files (tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, next.config.js)
- Implemented Supabase client for database connection
- Created database schema with SQL for Supabase
- Designed decision tree data structure with question and result nodes
- Implemented UI components for the decision tree flow
- Added progress tracking and path history display
- Enhanced recommendations with more thoughtful guidance
- Created comprehensive documentation (README, DEPLOYMENT.md, TESTING.md)
- Added Git configuration files (.gitignore, LICENSE)
- Created Git initialization scripts for easy repository setup
- Updated Memory Bank documentation to reflect current project status
- Enhanced DEPLOYMENT.md with more detailed instructions
- Initialized Git repository with initial commit
- Created step-by-step deployment checklist (DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md)
- Created local testing scripts (test-local.bat and test-local.sh)
- Set up .env.local file for local development
- Updated README.md with deployment information

## Next Steps

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Create a new GitHub repository
   - Push the local repository to GitHub
   - Configure repository settings

2. **Supabase Setup**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the schema.sql script to set up the database schema
   - Generate API keys for the application
   - Configure row-level security policies

3. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Create a new Vercel project
   - Connect to the GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy the application

All the necessary files and documentation have been prepared to facilitate these steps. The user can now follow the detailed instructions in DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md to complete the deployment process.

3. **Integration**
   - Update the application to use the Supabase backend
   - Test the connection to ensure data is being retrieved correctly
   - Implement error handling for API calls

4. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test the application with real users
   - Gather feedback on the decision tree logic
   - Refine the questions and recommendations
   - Improve the user interface based on feedback

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Requirements
- Evaluating whether authentication should be required or optional
- Considering role-based access control needs (regular users vs. management)
- Determining what user information needs to be stored

### Data Persistence
- Deciding what user data and responses should be stored
- Considering privacy implications and data retention policies
- Evaluating whether to store decision history for analytics

### User Experience
- Balancing simplicity with comprehensive decision-making
- Ensuring the application is accessible to all users
- Making the decision tree logic transparent and trustworthy

### Deployment Strategy
- Considering whether to use a staging environment for testing
- Planning for continuous integration and deployment
- Determining how to handle version updates to the decision tree

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript for all components and functions
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consistent naming conventions

### Component Structure
- Atomic design principles
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable, composable components
- Consistent prop interfaces

### State Management
- React useState and useEffect hooks for local state
- Potential future implementation of React Context for global state
- Clear data flow patterns

### API Integration
- Supabase client for database operations
- Error handling and loading states
- Caching strategies for improved performance

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- JSON is an effective format for storing hierarchical decision tree data
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with consistent design
- Next.js provides a solid foundation for building a responsive web application
- TypeScript helps catch errors early and improves code quality

### User Experience Insights
- Progress indicators help users understand where they are in the decision process
- Path history provides context and transparency
- Clear recommendations with next steps are essential for user confidence
- Mobile responsiveness is critical for accessibility

### Challenges Addressed
- Designed a flexible decision tree structure that can handle complex branching
- Created a responsive UI that works well on both desktop and mobile
- Implemented a mock decision tree for development without requiring Supabase connection
- Balanced simplicity with comprehensive decision-making

### Future Opportunities
- Custom decision tree editor for administrators
- Analytics dashboard for management insights
- Integration with ticketing or issue management systems
- Department-specific decision trees
