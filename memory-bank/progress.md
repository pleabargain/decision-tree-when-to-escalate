### Phase 3: User Experience
- [x] Design and implement UI/UX
- [x] Create responsive layouts
- [x] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Implement accessibility features
- [x] Create error states and fallbacks
- [x] Add loading indicators
- [x] Implement form validation

### Phase 4: Deployment and Testing
- [x] Prepare for GitHub publication
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Set up Vercel project
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Perform manual testing
- [ ] Conduct accessibility audit
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Deployment Phase - Git Repository Initialized

We have successfully implemented the decision tree application with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application includes a complete decision tree flow with questions, options, and recommendations that have been enhanced to provide more thoughtful guidance. The UI is responsive and includes progress tracking and path history display.

The database schema for Supabase has been designed and is ready to be implemented. The application currently uses a mock decision tree for development, but is structured to easily connect to Supabase once deployed.

We have prepared the project for GitHub publication by adding a comprehensive .gitignore file, an MIT license, and Git initialization scripts for both Unix/Linux/Mac and Windows environments. The Git repository has been initialized with an initial commit.

The next immediate steps are to:
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the local repository
2. Set up a Supabase project and run the schema.sql script
3. Deploy the application to Vercel
4. Connect the application to the Supabase backend
5. Test the application with real users

## Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**: There are TypeScript errors in the codebase due to missing dependencies. These will be resolved once the dependencies are installed.
2. **Authentication**: Authentication is not yet implemented. This will be added in a future phase if required.
3. **Accessibility**: The application needs to be audited for accessibility compliance.
4. **Testing**: No automated tests have been implemented yet.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Project Scope
- Decided to focus on a web application rather than a native mobile app for broader accessibility
- Chose to use Next.js and Supabase for rapid development and scalability
- Opted for a TypeScript-first approach to ensure type safety and better developer experience

### Architecture Decisions
- Selected a JAMstack architecture with Next.js and Supabase
- Decided to use React Context for state management rather than Redux due to the application's scope
- Chose Tailwind CSS for styling to enable rapid UI development
- Decided to implement a component-based architecture following atomic design principles

### Data Model Considerations
- Implemented a JSON-based data structure for the decision tree to allow for complex branching
- Designed a database schema that can store multiple decision trees
- Added support for tracking user decision paths for potential analytics

### Implementation Decisions
- Created a mock decision tree for development to allow work to proceed without Supabase connection
- Implemented a responsive UI that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Added progress tracking to help users understand where they are in the decision process
- Included path history display to show users the decisions they've made
- Enhanced recommendations to emphasize direct communication before escalation
- Provided more comprehensive next steps for both escalation and non-escalation paths

### GitHub Publication Decisions
- Created a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files
- Added an MIT license file as referenced in the README
- Created Git initialization scripts for both Unix/Linux/Mac and Windows
- Updated documentation to include GitHub repository setup instructions

### Future Considerations
- May need to implement a custom decision tree editor for administrators
- Might require integration with existing ticketing or issue management systems
- Could expand to include department-specific decision trees
- May need to add analytics dashboard for management insights
