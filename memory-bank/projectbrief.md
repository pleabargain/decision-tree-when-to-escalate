# Project Brief: Decision Tree for Issue Escalation

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a web application that guides users through a series of questions to determine whether an issue should be escalated to management. The application will be built using Vercel for deployment and Supabase for backend services.

## Core Requirements

1. **Decision Tree Interface**
   - Present users with a series of questions in a logical flow
   - Each question should have clear, distinct answer options
   - Questions should adapt based on previous answers
   - Provide a clear recommendation at the end of the flow

2. **User Experience**
   - Clean, intuitive interface
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Clear progress indication
   - Ability to go back and change answers

3. **Data Management**
   - Store decision tree structure in Supabase
   - Log completed assessments (optional, based on requirements)
   - Secure data handling

4. **Authentication**
   - Basic user authentication (optional, based on requirements)
   - Role-based access if management needs to review escalations

5. **Deployment**
   - Continuous deployment via Vercel
   - Environment configuration for development, staging, and production

## Success Criteria

1. Users can complete the decision tree flow without confusion
2. The application provides consistent, logical recommendations
3. The system is reliable and performs well under load
4. The application is secure and protects user data
5. The code is maintainable and well-documented

## Out of Scope (Initial Release)

1. Integration with ticketing systems
2. Complex analytics dashboard
3. Custom decision tree builder interface
4. Mobile applications (beyond responsive web)

## Timeline
To be determined based on project planning and resource allocation.

## Stakeholders
- End users (employees who need guidance on escalation)
- Management (who receive escalated issues)
- Project sponsor (who commissioned the application)
