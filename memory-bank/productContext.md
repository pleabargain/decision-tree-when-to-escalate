# Product Context: Decision Tree for Issue Escalation

## Why This Project Exists

Organizations often struggle with consistent decision-making around when to escalate issues to management. This leads to several problems:

1. **Inconsistent Escalation**: Some employees escalate too frequently, while others rarely do so, even when warranted
2. **Management Overload**: Unnecessary escalations consume management time and resources
3. **Delayed Resolution**: Critical issues that should be escalated are sometimes handled at lower levels, delaying proper resolution
4. **Employee Uncertainty**: Team members often feel unsure about when an issue warrants escalation
5. **Lack of Documentation**: The decision process for escalation is rarely documented, making it difficult to improve

This application aims to solve these problems by providing a structured, consistent approach to determining when an issue should be escalated to management.

## Problems It Solves

### For Individual Contributors

- Creates documentation of the decision process

### For Management
- Reduces unnecessary escalations
- Ensures important issues reach management attention
- Standardizes the escalation process across teams
- Provides data on common escalation patterns
- Helps identify training opportunities

### For the Organization
- Improves efficiency in issue resolution
- Creates consistency in process
- Builds institutional knowledge
- Enhances communication between levels
- Supports better resource allocation

## How It Should Work

The application follows a simple but effective workflow:

1. **Issue Identification**: User begins by entering basic information about the issue
2. **Guided Assessment**: The system presents a series of questions that branch based on previous answers
3. **Contextual Factors**: Questions consider factors like:
   - Issue severity
   - Business impact
   - Urgency/time sensitivity
   - Resources required
   - Authority needed
   - Risk assessment
4. **Recommendation**: Based on responses, the system provides a clear recommendation
5. **Next Steps**: If escalation is recommended, guidance on how to properly escalate is provided
6. **Documentation**: The decision process is documented for reference
